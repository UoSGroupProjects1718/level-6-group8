Hamsterdam Feedback:

- wasn't told to select basil again
- too much text in the first box
- moves slightly faster on mobile than tablet
- was worried the buttons were inaccessible when pressed
- overworld scrolling is so slow and seems to work in the opposite direction to what I was expecting
- should be swipe to scroll instead of hold to scroll for overworld and factory
- factory is much faster than overworld
- why do I need to unlock the first section, should be unlocked by default
- still too dark in overworld
- score to earn stars in each factory makes no sense, if I only need 30 to get 3 stars, why is my score 840?
- highscores????
- can't read all the text in "Bubbas Brewer"
- why are there so many potions
- scrolling in spell book starts part way down, couldn't see that there was more above
- majority of potions are called booster, so couldn't find the one I needed
- menus open quite quickly
- didn't know I had to click the mayor to close dialog box
- potion icons look very good
- had to click numbing potion 3 times
- can't close the book from the numbing potion page, even though there's an X there
- what does efficiency mean?
- no real coherent tutorial in the first section, just seems like random levels
- appreciate the hint about the spell book in each level screen
- button showed as pressed only works the first time you press a button
- the right hand grinder in "Millys Muller" was incorrectly rotated
- try again button took me back to the overworld
- the target scores randomly changed for "Fluffballs Fermenting Inc."
- Factory descriptions are somewhat redundant
- Punctuation
- question mark brings up required potion again which is really useful
- empty button above the oven?
- caused phone to get very hot
- scrolling in the spell book causes the spell book button to close in background
- icon problems on potions that need 4 ingredients but only two machines, shows both large and smaller icons at the same time
- input icons try to rotate on lower inputters in FFI factory
- can't physically complete FFI factory because of input placement
- section 2 has old models
- section 2 didn't light up when unlocked
- overworld camera resets everytime you come back after finishing a level, it's annoying to have to move it back to another section
